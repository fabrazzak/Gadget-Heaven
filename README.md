## React Fundamental Concepts Used
This project utilizes various React fundamental concepts, including:
- **Components**: Used to build the user interface and separate functionality.
- **JSX**: Used for writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
- **Props**: For passing data from parent to child components.
- **State**: Used to manage component data and trigger re-renders.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Used for managing side effects (e.g., fetching data).
- **Context API**: For global state management (cart and wishlist).
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages and routes.
- **Custom Hooks**: To encapsulate reusable logic.

## Data Management
- **Context API**: Used to manage the cart and wishlist globally across the application.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
2. **Structured Navigation**: A clear and intuitive navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the site.
3. **Product Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter products by category and sort them by price.
4. **Cart and Wishlist Functionality**: Users can add items to their cart or wishlist, view them on separate pages, and manage their selections.
5. **Smooth User Experience**: Features like smooth scrolling, modals for confirmations, and toast notifications enhance the overall user experience.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.

### Challenges and Future Enhancements
- Implementing price limits on the cart.
- Enhancing the statistics page with graphical data representations.
- Allowing users to remove items from both the cart and wishlist.
- Adding user authentication in the future.
